// Copyright (c) 2024 Botho Foundation

//! Client-side (WebAssembly) Botho transaction builder + CLSAG signer.
//!
//! This crate exposes the node-identical CLSAG transaction build + sign path
//! (from [`bth_transaction_clsag`]) to JavaScript via `wasm-bindgen`, so the
//! browser wallet can construct, sign, and serialize a transaction entirely
//! client-side. **The spend key never leaves the browser** — it is passed in
//! by the caller (who holds it locally) and is used only to recover the
//! one-time private key and produce the ring signature.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! [`build_and_sign`] returns the **bincode** serialization of a
//! [`bth_transaction_clsag::Transaction`] as a hex string. This is exactly the
//! `tx_hex` payload the node accepts in its `tx_submit` JSON-RPC method, so the
//! output round-trips through the same Rust verifier the node uses.
//!
//! # Decoy selection
//!
//! Decoy (ring-member) selection is performed off this crate: the JS caller
//! fetches candidate outputs via RPC (`chain_getOutputs`) and passes them in as
//! `decoys`. This keeps the wasm surface small and the privacy-sensitive
//! mixing policy in one place. The signer shuffles the real input among the
//! decoys so its position is hidden.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! The pure-Rust [`core`] module is exercised by native `cargo test`
//! (sign -> verify round-trip), which is the highest-value provable slice:
//! correctness of the produced transaction against the same verifier the node
//! runs. The `wasm-bindgen` layer is a thin serde shim over it.
