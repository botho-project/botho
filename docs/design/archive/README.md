# Archived Design Documents

This directory contains design documents that have been **withdrawn** or **superseded**.

Documents are archived rather than deleted to:
- Preserve the reasoning that led to their withdrawal
- Provide historical context for design decisions
- Allow future reviewers to understand why certain approaches were abandoned

## Archived Documents

| Document | Reason | Superseded By |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| [wealth-conditional-privacy.md](wealth-conditional-privacy.md) | Based on flawed premise (tracking wealth vs minting proximity) | [minting-proximity-fees.md](../minting-proximity-fees.md) |
| [wealth-privacy-simulation.md](wealth-privacy-simulation.md) | Simulation for withdrawn design | [asymmetric-fees-simulation.md](../asymmetric-fees-simulation.md) |
| [provenance-based-selection.md](provenance-based-selection.md) | Superseded by combined mechanism | [asymmetric-utxo-fees.md](../asymmetric-utxo-fees.md) |

## Reading Archived Documents

Each archived document has a **Status** section at the top explaining:
- Why it was archived
- What document(s) supersede it
- Any parts that remain valuable for reference

## Unarchiving

If an archived design becomes relevant again (e.g., new insights make a withdrawn approach viable), it can be moved back to the main design directory with updated status.
